# Introduction

This Project has started as a feature request at Google to go ahead and improve their Online Labelling Service. Since, that does not do the trick, I have created this OpenSource Project to convert Vott Labelled Images to Google Cloud AutoML Format for a Single One Click Automatic Importing Service. 

This Service Includes Python Modules, and Command Line Utlities along with a GUI, that helps fast track this into a fully featured Click and Go. It automatically uploads your images to a Google Cloud Storage Bucket that you can specify, whereby also converting the co-ordinates in the required Google Cloud Fashion.
